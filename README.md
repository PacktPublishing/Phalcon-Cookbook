#Phalcon Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Phalcon Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/phalcon-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784396886), published by [Packt](www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Phalcon is a high-performance PHP framework delivered as a PHP extension. This provides new opportunities for speed and application design, which until recently have been unrealized in the PHP ecosystem.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<?php
class Hats extends Phalcon\Mvc\Model
{}
```

This book requires PHP 5.5 or later, a web server, database server, and command line access.
Although any web and database server can be used in this book, the reader will have a much
easier time with Apache and MySQL. This book makes extensive use of the Phalcon Developer
Tools to create projects, and this will require command line usage. Some recipes in this book
will require speci fi c PHP extensions and so the reader will need to have the ability to install
these extensions on their machine as well as the ability to restart the web and database
server, to read the web server logs and many other things that require administrator access.
Windows, Mac, and Linux are all supported environments.
